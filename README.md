# Paing Phyo Ko - a dedicated learner from FAC29A Cohort

## Welcome to Paing's portfolio!
- This portfolio serves two key purposes:

1. **Demonstrating Learning Outcomes:** It showcases the skills and knowledge I've developed throughout the Founders and Coders course, featuring code snippets and project screenshots as proof of my technical abilities and understanding.

2. **Highlighting Ongoing Development:** Designed to illustrate my continuous growth as a programmer, this portfolio not only reflects the depth of learning during the course but also my commitment to advancing in the tech industry. It's a dynamic record of my journey, marking each stage of the program with the skills and insights I've gained.
